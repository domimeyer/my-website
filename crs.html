Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR)
spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) (E > 0.1 TeV) range mainly via two mechanisms: hadronic
interactions of accelerated protons with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions of accelerated electrons with soft photons.
Observations with current instruments have lead to the detection of about a dozen of SNRs emitting VHE gamma-rays and future in-
struments should significantly increase this number. Yet, the details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing
VHE gamma-rays at SNRs remain poorly understood.
We aim at studying the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and confront it to simulated samples,
in order to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What
is the efficiency of particle acceleration? Is the gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions?
Methods. By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the gamma–ray domain and confront our
simulations to the catalogue of sources from the systematic survey of the Galactic plane performed by H.E.S.S. (HGPS).
We systematically explore the parameter space defined in our model, including e.g., the slope of accelerated particles α, the
electron-to-proton ratio Kep, and the efficiency of particle acceleration ξ. In particular, we found possible sets of parameters for which
≳ 90% of Monte Carlo realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are typically found 4.2 ≳ α ≳ 4.1,
10−5 ≲ Kep ≲ 10−4.5, and 0.03 ≲ ξ ≲ 0.1 . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space, such as e.g.
α ≲ 4.05, α ≳ 4.35, or Kep ≳ 10−3.
Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of
future systematic surveys, such as with the Cherenkov Telescope Array, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better
understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks in the Galaxy.

In the core-collapse scenario, the supernova remnants (SNRs) evolve inside the complex wind-blown bubbles,
structured by massive progenitors during their lifetime. Therefore, particle acceleration and the emissions from these
SNRs can carry the fingerprints of the evolutionary sequences of the progenitor stars.
We time-dependently investigate the impact of the ambient environment of core-collapse SNRs on particle
spectra and the emissions, for two progenitors with different evolutionary tracks, accounting for the spatial transport
of cosmic rays (CRs) and the magnetic turbulence which scatters CRs.
We use the RATPaC code to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having zero-age
main sequence (ZAMS) masses of 20 Mo and 60 Mo. We have constructed the pre-supernova circumstellar medium
(CSM) by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of the progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for
cosmic rays, and magnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction equation for the evolution
of large-scale magnetic field have been solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of
SNRs inside the pre-supernova CSM in 1-D spherical symmetry.
The profiles of gas density and temperature of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the
scattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both SNRs. For the 60 Mo progenitor the spectral
index reaches 2.4 even below 10 GeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In contrast,
we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary stages of the SNR with 20 Mo progenitor, for which
the spectral index becomes 2.2 only for a brief period during the interaction of SNR shock with the dense shell of red
supergiant (RSG) wind material. At later stages of evolution, the spectra become soft above ∼ 10 GeV for both SNRs,
as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy particles from the remnants. The emission morphology
of the SNRs strongly depends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the SNR with 20 Mo
progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for the more massive progenitor is shell-like.

Core-collapse supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct massive stars which have died during a supernova explosion, mostly while undergoing the red supergiant phase of their evolution. The morphology and emission properties of those remnants are a function of the distribution of circumstellar material at the moment of the supernova, the intrisic properties of the explosion, as well as those of the ambient medium. By means of 2.5 dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we model the long term evolution of supernova remnants generated by runaway rotating massive stars moving into a magnetised interstellar medium. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that the projected non-thermal emission of the supernova remnants decreases with time, i.e. older remnants are fainter than younger ones. Older (80 kyr) supernova remnants whose progenitors were moving with space velocity corresponding to a Mach number M = 1 (v_star = 20 km/s ) in the Galactic plane of the ISM (nISM = 1/cm3 ) are brighter in synchrotron than when moving with a Mach number M = 2 (v_star = 40 km/s ). We show that runaway red supergiant progenitors first induce an asymmetric non thermal 1.4 GHz barrel like synchrotron supernova remnants (at the age of about 8 kyr), before further evolving to adopt a Cygnus loop like shape (at about 80 kyr). It is conjectured that a significative fraction of supernova remnants are currently in this bilateral-to-Cygnus-loop evolutionary sequence, and that this should be taken into account in the data interpretation of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.

Mixed-morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) are characterized by a shell-like morphology in the radio and centrally-peaked thermal emission in the X-ray band. The nature of this peculiar class of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a controversial issue. In this work, by pairing the predictions of stellar evolution theory with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the mixed morphology properties of a SNR can arise by the interaction of the SNR with the circumstellar medium shaped by a red supergiant progenitor star, embedded in a dense environment. As a study case, we model the circumstellar medium formation and the subsequent interaction of the SNR with it of a 15 Mo progenitor star. The reflected shock, formed by the collision of the SNR with the density walls of the surrounding circumstellar cavity, accumulates and re-shocks the supernova ejecta at the center of the remnant, increasing its temperature so that the gas becomes X-ray bright. Such a formation mechanism may naturally explain the nature of MMSNRs resulted from Type II supernovae without the demand of additional physical mechanisms and/or ambient medium inhomogeneities. We discuss alternative evolutionary paths that potentially could be ascribed for the MMSNR formation within the framework of the reflected shock model.

Supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct stellar environments, resulting from the interaction between a supernova blastwave and the circumstellar medium shaped by the progenitor throughout its life. They display a large variety of non-spherical morphologies such as ears that shine non-thermally. We have modelled the structure and the non-thermal emission of the supernova remnant G1.9 + 0.3 through 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations. We propose that the peculiar ear-shaped morphology of this supernova remnant results from the interaction of its blast wave with a magnetized circumstellar medium, which was previously asymmetrically shaped by the past stellar wind emanating from the progenitor star or its stellar companion. We created synthetic non-thermal radio and X-ray maps from our simulated remnant structure, which are in qualitative agreement with observations, forming ears on the polar directions. Our synthetic map study explains the discrepancies between the measured non-thermal radio and X-ray surface brightness distributions assuming that the inverse Compton process produces the observed X-ray emission.

Core-collapse supernova remnants are structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) left behind the explosive death of most massive stars (smaller than 40Mo). Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped by the star's wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly, fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants. We investigate the mixing of materials in core-collapse supernova remnants generated by a moving massive 35 Mo star, in a magnetized ISM. Stellar rotation and the wind magnetic field are time-dependently included into the models which follow the entire evolution of the stellar surroundings from the zero-age main-sequence to 80 kyr after the supernova explosion. It is found that very little main-sequence material is present in remnants from moving stars, that the Wolf-Rayet wind mixes very efficiently within the 10 kyr after the explosion, while the red supergiant material is still unmixed by 30 per cent within 50kyr after the supernova. Our results indicate that the faster the stellar motion, the more complex the internal organization of the supernova remnant and the more effective the mixing of ejecta therein. In contrast, the mixing of stellar wind material is only weakly affected by progenitor motion, if at all.

Thermonuclear and core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) are the nebular leftovers of defunct stars. Their morphology and
emission properties provide insights into the evolutionary history of the progenitor star. But while some SNRs are spherical,
as expected from a point-like explosion expanding into a roughly uniform medium, many others exhibit complex non-spherical
morphologies which are often not easily explained. In this work, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
show that rectangular and jet-like morphologies can be explained by supernovae (SNe), either type Ia or type II, expanding within
anisotropic, bipolar stellar wind bubbles driven by the progenitor star. The stellar wind has an anisotropic density distribution,
which channels the SN ejecta differently depending on the anisotropy characteristics. We compute synthetic thermal (X-ray) and
non-thermal (synchrotron) emission maps from our numerical simulations to compare with observations. We find rectangular
morphologies are generated when the stellar wind has a high mass loss rate and forms a dense, narrow disk at the equatorial
region. Instead, a jet-like or ear-like morphology is obtained when the stellar wind develops a wide, dense disk. Stellar winds
with low mass-loss rates do not strongly influence the SNR morphology. Finally, our synthetic synchrotron and X-ray maps for
the high mass-loss rate case qualitatively agree with the observations of the SNRs G332.5-5.6 and G290.1-0.8.

Core-collapse supernova remnants are the gaseous nebulae of galactic interstellar media (ISM) formed after the explosive death
of massive stars. Their morphology and emission properties depend both on the surrounding circumstellar structure shaped by
the stellar wind-ISM interaction of the progenitor star and on the local conditions of the ambient medium. In the warm phase
of the Galactic plane (n = 1 cm-3, T = 8000 K), an organised magnetic field of strength 7 microG has profound consequences
on the morphology of the wind bubble of massive stars at rest. In this paper we show through 2.5D magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations, in the context of a Wolf-Rayet-evolving 35 Mo star, that it affects the development of its supernova remnant. When
the supernova remnant reaches its middle age (15-20 kyr), it adopts a tubular shape that results from the interaction between
the isotropic supernova ejecta and the anisotropic, magnetised, shocked stellar progenitor bubble into which the supernova blast
wave expands. Our calculations for non-thermal emission, i.e. radio synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, reveal that such
supernova remnants can, due to projection effects, appear as rectangular objects in certain cases. This mechanism for shaping a
supernova remnant is similar to the bipolar and elliptical planetary nebula production by wind-wind interaction in the low-mass
regime of stellar evolution. If such a rectangular core-collapse supernova remnant is created, the progenitor star must not have
been a runaway star. We propose that such a mechanism is at work in the shaping of the asymmetric core-collapse supernova
remnant Puppis A.

Context. Galactic cosmic rays are widely assumed to arise from diffusive shock acceleration, specifically at shocks 
in supernova remnants (SNRs). These shocks expand in a complex environment, particularly in the core-collapse 
scenario as these SNRs evolve inside the wind-blown bubbles created by their progenitor stars. The cosmic rays 
(CRs) at core-collapse SNRs may carry spectral signatures of that complexity. Aims. We study particle acceleration 
in the core-collapse SNR of a progenitor with initial mass 60 M⊙ and realistic stellar evolution. The SNR shock 
interacts with discontinuities inside the wind-blown bubble and generates several transmitted and reflected shocks. 
We analyse their impact on particle spectra and the resulting emission from the remnant. Methods. The hydrodynamic 
equations for the evolution of SNR inside the pre-supernova circumstellar medium have been solved simultaneously 
with the transport equation for cosmic rays in test-particle approximation and with the induction equation for the 
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in 1-D spherical symmetry. Results. The evolution of core-collapse SNRs inside complex 
wind-blown bubbles modifies the spectra of both the particles and their emission. We have found softer particle 
spectra with spectral indices close to 2.5 during shock propagation inside the shocked wind, and this softness 
persists at later evolutionary stages. Further, our calculated total production spectrum released into the 
interstellar medium demonstrates spectral consistency at high energy with the galactic CRs injection spectrum, 
required in propagation models. The magnetic field structure effectively influences the emission morphology of 
SNR as it governs the transportation of particles and the synchrotron emissivity.

A  signification  fraction  of  Galactic  massive  stars  (>8 Mo)  are  ejected  from  their  parentcluster 
and supersonically sail away through the interstellar medium (ISM). The winds ofthese fast-moving stars blow 
asymmetric bubbles thus creating a circumstellar environment in which stars eventually die with a supernova 
explosion. The morphology of the resultingremnant is largely governed by the circumstellar medium of the defunct 
progenitor star. Inthis paper, we present 2D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations investigating the effect of the 
ISM magnetic field on the shape of the supernova remnants of a 35 M* evolving through a Wolf-Rayet phase and 
running with velocity 20 and 40 km/s, respectively. A 7 microG ambientmagnetic field is sufficient to modify 
the properties of the expanding supernova shock frontand in particular to prevent the formation of filamentary 
structures. Prior to the supernova ex-plosion, the compressed magnetic field in the circumstellar medium 
stabilises the wind/ISMcontact discontinuity in the tail of the wind bubble. A consequence is a reduced mixing 
effi-ciency of ejecta and wind materials in the inner region of the remnant, where the supernova shock wave 
propagates. Radiative transfer calculations for synchrotron emission reveal thatthe non-thermal radio emission 
has characteristic features reflecting the asymmetry of exiledcore-collapse supernova remnants from Wolf-Rayet 
progenitors. Our models are qualitatively consistent with the radio appearance of several remnants of high-mass 
progenitors, namelythe bilateral G296.5+10.0 and the shell-type remnants CTB109 and Kes 17, respectively.

Supernova remnants often evolve in material with high abundance of heavy elements such as
carbon or oxygen. Hadronic collisions in these enriched media spawn the production of secondary
particles such as gamma rays, neutrinos, and secondary electrons with spectra that cannot
be scaled from those calculated for pp collisions, potentially leading to erroneous results.
We used Monte-Carlo event generators to calculate the dierential production rate of secondary
particles such as gamma rays, neutrinos, and secondary electrons for H, He, C, and O nuclei as
projectiles and as target material. The cross sections and the multiplicity spectra are separately
computed for each of the 16 combinations of projectile and target. We describe characteristic
eects of heavy nuclei in the shape and normalization of spectra of secondary particles.

A very small fraction of (runaway) massive stars have masses exceeding 60-70 Mo and are
predicted to evolve as Luminous-Blue-Variable andWolf-Rayet stars before ending their lives
as core-collapse supernovae. Our 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations explore how
a fast wind (2000 km/s) and high mass-loss rate (1.0e-5 Mo/yr) can impact the morphology
of the circumstellar medium. It is shaped as 100 pc-scale wind nebula which can be
pierced by the driving star when it supersonically moves with velocity 20-40 km/s through
the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Galactic plane. The motion of such runaway stars displaces
the position of the supernova explosion out of their bow shock nebula, imposing asymmetries
to the eventual shock wave expansion and engendering Cygnus-loop-like supernova
remnants.We conclude that the size (up to more than 200 pc) of the filamentary wind cavity in
which the chemically enriched supernova ejecta expand, mixing efficiently the wind and ISM
materials by at least 10% in number density, can be used as a tracer of the runaway nature
of the very massive progenitors of such 0:1 Myr old remnants. Our results motivate further
observational campaigns devoted to the bow shock of the very massive stars BD+43 3654 and
to the close surroundings of the synchrotron-emitting Wolf-Rayet shell G2.4+1.4.

After the death of a runaway massive star, its supernova shock wave interacts
with the bow shocks produced by its defunct progenitor, and may lose 
energy, momentum, and its spherical symmetry before expanding into the local interstellar medium (ISM). We
investigate whether the initial mass and space velocity of these progenitors can
be associated with asymmetric supernova remnants. We run hydrodynamical models
of supernovae exploding in the pre-shaped medium of moving Galactic
core-collapse progenitors. We find that bow shocks that accumulate more than
about 1.5 Mo generate asymmetric remnants. The shock wave first
collides with these bow shocks 160-750 yr after the supernova, and the
collision lasts until 830 4900 yr. The shock wave is then located
1.35-5 pc from the center of the explosion, and it expands freely into
the ISM, whereas in the opposite direction it is channelled into the region of
undisturbed wind material. This applies to an initially 20 Mo 
progenitor moving with velocity 20 km/s and to our initially
40 Mo progenitor. These remnants generate mixing of ISM gas,
stellar wind and supernova ejecta that is particularly important upstream from
the center of the explosion. Their lightcurves are dominated by emission from
optically-thin cooling and by X-ray emission of the shocked ISM gas. We find
that these remnants are  likely to be observed in the [OIII] 
5007 spectral line emission or in the soft energy-band of X-rays. Finally, we
discuss our results in the context of observed Galactic supernova remnants such
as 3C391 and the Cygnus Loop. </div>						<br>
